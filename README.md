It all started in 2011 four students the Stanford Graduate School of Business wanted to provide more affordable options for students who were accumulating student debt.

## Sofi's Challanges in the Industry

SoFi operates in the following FinTech domains

- Robo-advising 
- Open Banking
- Lending
- Insurance
- Investment management.
- Wealth Management
- Payments and Billing


To define about Sofi's challenges, we need to look at the state of the FinTech Industry and what is effects of outside forces.  The most pressing issue is the Federal government’s [Student Loan forgiveness program.][10]  The Supreme Court is set hear arguments February 28 2023. This issue is creating downward pressure on Sofi’s stock Price.  Until this case is decided, investors will be wary.  Noto has done shifted focus from student loans to other products and service to balance out the detriment effects of Student Loan Forgiveness program.  In fact, SoFi is driving potential members to it's website with the latest information on the program. In effect using the Issue to enhance education for their members


The FTX scandal is eroding public trust on the crypto and blockchain sector, as details on who, what where and when needs to see daylight.  Sofi has fees attached to the crypto exchange part of their business.  The [lack of regulation][6] of crypto erodes consumer confidence, regulation clarity is needed to restore confidence.

​
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
​
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
​
* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

​
### 4. Write the case study.
​
Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.
​
Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.
​
​
### 5. Upload your case study to your git repository.
​
You learned some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it to a repository to share with your instructor and class.
